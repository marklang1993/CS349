6/6 - Model-View-Controller used effectively. 
	2/2	Model has a list of observers (restricted interface) or extends Observable
	2/2	Calls update method for each item on the list at the end of each public
		method that mutates state
	2/2	Listeners appropriate to the controller  (Only mouse listeners = 0)

15/15 User interface elements and layout
	3/3	The UI has at least three parts:  a canvas for the image, a list of entities
		and a list of arrows.
	3/3	It's easy to correctly identify the list of entities vs. list of arrows
	3/3	Entities list shows the entity name;  arrows list shows the two entities connected
	3/3	The entities are laid out in a pleasing arrangment.
	3/3	Resizing the window (within reasonable limits) maintains a pleasing arrangment.


21/21	Functional Requirements

	7/7	Entity Creation
		3/3	Interaction for creating entities works well from a human perspective.
		2/2	New entity can be named
		2/2	New entity appears at a specified location

	4/4	Selection
		2/2	Selecting an entity on the canvas: changes its appearance
			selects the corresponding item on the entities list
		1/1	Selecting an entity in the entities list: changes its appearance
			selects the corresponding entity on the canvas
		1/1	Selecting an arrow in the arrows list:  changes its appearance,
			selects both entities in the entities list, selects stuff on canvas
	 
	10/10 - Entity Movement and Arrow Adjustment
		5/5	Entities can be moved to other locations on the canvas. 
		5/5	Arrows remain connected to the moved entity and re-position accordingly.

5/5: “Good Job!”  Obvious attention to detail
