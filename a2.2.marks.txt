Entity Relationship Model

1/3	Includes MVC infrastructure or extends Observable
	0/1	List of objects implementing IView (or extends ...)
	0/1	Method to add views to the list
	1/1	Update all views at end of public methods
		that change the model
                -- You should use an interface to refer to the view from the model, not the EREditView class itself.

4/4	Methods needed by controllers
	1/1	Add a new entity
	1/1	Give an entity a name
	1/1	Specify a relationship between two entities
	1/1	Specify a new position for an entity


4/4	Methods needed by views
	1/1	Get a list of entities 
		(or some way of iterating through them)
	1/1	Given an entity, get a list of related entities
	1/1	Given an entity, get information such as
		name, location
	1/1	Given a relationship (arrow), get the entities
		it connects

4/4	Tests
	One mark for each of four tests that:
	-	Is different from the others
	-	Runs and "passes"
	-	Is of the form (a) create a new object, (b) call
		one or more methods that change state, and (c) 
		verify the expected results.

Note: Although you did not loose marks in this part of the assignment, your division of responsibilities
between Model and Controller is not right. You are giving to the Model responsibilities that should be on the
Controller. The Model should just give information about it to the Controller/View or update the information 
as requested by the Controller. However, the Model should never <decide what to do>: that's a control function.
For example; the Model should not decide if a click should activate an addition, selection, or edition.
That's the Controller's job. Move all this decision logic to your Controller.
