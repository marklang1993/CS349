12/17 - Zooming & Panning
	4/4	Functionality for zooming exists for zooming at 10% increments using the 
		mouse scroll wheel [2], as well as “Ctrl+[“ and “Ctrl+]” [2].
	0/2	Zooming is about the center or the mouse.
	2/4	Functionality exists for repositioning the diagram. [2] Uses direct manipulation. [2]
	4/4	Group 3 features (creating entities, selecting and moving entities, connecting with arrows)
		continues to work well with a zoomed/panned graphic.
	2/3	Zooming and panning is implemented with affine transforms.
		[3] if zooming/panning manipulates a matrix directly;  
		[2] if values are stored and then placed in a matrix prior to drawing.
		[0] if affine transform is not used.

3/3 - Arrow Orthogonality
	/1	Arrows connecting two entities are correctly orthogonal upon creation.
	/2	Arrows orthogonality persists when a connected entity is moved in the diagram.


10/10 - Enhancement
	/5	Enhancement is well thought-out. Time was clearly spent toward design and implementation.
	/5	Enhancement is functional.

		Examples:
		Jog adjustment:  7
		Applying colors to entities:  3
		Save/Load 10 (with menus), 5 (with buttons)
		Grid and/or other drawing aids 
		Other tools
